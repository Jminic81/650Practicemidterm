#Re:  See tab = "practice.R" - all three graphs display properly!
#Re:  See tab =  "Flexdash.Rmd" - the histograph displayed on the dashboard but when I
#     added the time series plots I get an error message "...object 'num-accidents' 
#     not found...."

#     Add:  the example dashboard had same set up for all three plots - I think the two 
#     Time Series are different than the histogram?
